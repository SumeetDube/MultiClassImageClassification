## Multi-Class Image Classification Project

This project implements a multi-class image classification model using deep learning techniques: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning). 

### Project Overview

This project aims to train a model to classify images into one of several predefined categories. Here's a breakdown of the functionalities:

* **Data Preparation:** 
    * Load and pre-process image datasets.
    * Implement data augmentation techniques.
* **Model Architecture:**
    * Define a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for image classification.
* **Model Training:**
    * Train the model on the prepared dataset.
    * Monitor training progress using metrics like accuracy and loss.
    * Implement techniques like early stopping and regularization to prevent overfitting.
* **Evaluation:**
    * Evaluate the model performance on the held-out testing set.
    * Calculate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
    * Visualize the model's predictions.

### Dependencies

This project requires the following libraries:

* TensorFlow/PyTorch (for deep learning)
* NumPy (for numerical computations)
* OpenCV (for image processing)
* scikit-learn (for data manipulation)
* Matplotlib (for visualization) (optional)

**Note:** The specific libraries may vary depending on your implementation choices.

### Project Structure

The project includes the following folders and files:

* `dataset/`: Contains the image datasets for training, validation, and testing.
* `src/`: Contains the source code for data preparation, model definition, training, and evaluation.
* `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python libraries.
